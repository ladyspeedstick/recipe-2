<div id="middle"><h4>Paneer is Indian cheese
but it <div class="fancy"> doesn't melt.</div> So get that out of your head.</h4></div>

<div id="lower"><h5>Why use it, then? 
Well because it's filling, it's a meat substitute and it gives the dish a more complex texture.</h5></div>

<div id="lowest">It also tastes a hell of a lot better than the average firm tofu.</div>

<p>Important Notes:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Toasting the mustard seeds at the beginning makes you an honourary Indian. Totally adds legitimacy. Don't skip this step!</li>
		<li><div class="yuck">TOAST THOSE CURRIES!</div>There's nothing worse than raw curry flavour,<div class="yuck">yuck.</div>
	</li>
	<li>There are no quantities for this recipe because curry isn't designed to be held back by quantities. I'll give you some approximates, but trust your palate!</li></ul></p>
	<p>Instructions:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Dice your paneer and sear each side in a frying pan with. Set aside.</li>
	<li>Heat equal amounts of oil and butter in a dutch oven or stock pot that had a lid (enough to coat the bottom).</li>
	<li>Toast your mustard seeds(maybe... 2 tbsp, 3-4 minutes).</li>
	<li>Add your powdered curries/spices to taste (2 to 1 parts cumin to coriander, .5 part of cardamom, and as much of the garam masala or any other flexible Indian spice mix as you'd like!)</li>
	<li>Roughly chop your onion and garlic (1/2 an onion roughly chopped and like, 4-6 cloves of garic is what I usually deal with). Soften in the delicious-smelling hot pot.</li>
	<li>Add your spinch to the pot and wilt the crap out of it (put the lid on, simmer on LOW until you're all wilty).</li>
	<li>Add your cilantro last to retain it's flavour. I put a whole bunch in, but this is optional.</li>
	<li>Taking extreme care, put some of the contents of your stock pot  in your blender and WHIZZ them up in batches! Blend that mess until it's consistancy is to your liking.</li>
	<li>Add the blender contents back to the pot</li>
	<li>To the green goop add the remaining ingredients to taste, adding the paneer last.</li></ul>

	<h6>Saagcess!!</h6>

	<div id="texty">Serve with naan and rice, or just rice. If you make this the night before the flavors will have a chance to intermingle nicely. This dish makes excellent leftovers.</div>
